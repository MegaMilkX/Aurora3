## Creating a project

* First, locate the "ENGINE\_PATH/BuildTools/katana\_build/init\_project.py" script. Run it with a command line parameter containing the path to the directory you wish your project to be created in. If the directory does't exist it will be created. After the script is done, there will be a new project config file inside.

* Next step is to edit the newly created project config to your liking, including its name.
